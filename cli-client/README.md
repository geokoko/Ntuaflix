# CLI client

To recognize the "se2342" file as executable, we need to run the following command while already in the path ./cli-client:

`chmod +x se2342`

Depending on how Python commands are invoked in our environment, we need to uncomment the corresponding line in the file se2343.

Also, due to the composition of our data, we need to change our encoding by running the following command:

`export PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8`
